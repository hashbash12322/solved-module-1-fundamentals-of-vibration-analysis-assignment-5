Starting from the experimental data collected into <em>Data.mat </em>file:

<ul>

 <li>implement the Matlab script for identifying the modes according to the procedure described in previous slides;</li>

 <li>test the software capabilities on the provided FRFs; 3) summarize the results in terms of:

  <ul>

   <li>natural frequencies and damping ratios;</li>

   <li>comparison of experimental and identified FRFs (for a certain reference channel);</li>

   <li>visualization of the identified modes.</li>

  </ul></li>
